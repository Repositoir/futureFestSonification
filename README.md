# Sonification

Sonification is the process of converting an image into sound. Our project converted the image
of the Pillars of Creation into piano notes based on the RGB biases in parts of the image and
also the brightness of the image in some parts when converting it to grayscale.

## Content

This repository contains all the python code pertaining to image to sound conversion in the
`imageConversion` directory. On the main page is the code for the unfinished website for the project
which was created using NextJS.
